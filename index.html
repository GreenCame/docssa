                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Why does DoCSSa exist ?</h2>

                        <p>As frontend web developers, we are living in a world of evergrowing complexity. What once was a
                            relatively easy thing to do (putting aside browsers inconsistencies) has grown into a very complex,
                            dynamic, everchanging reality.</p>

                        <p>So, we need flexible structure in order to be more efficient and less
                            under pressure when the rough times come. The way we see it, the more work we
                            can avoid by having defined the right tools and the right architecture ahead of time, the better.</p>

                        <p>DoCSSa is our attempt at an organization that aims toward a faster workflow without sacrificing the
                            long run flexibility.</p>

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">How does DoCSSa bring its benefits ?</h2>

                        <p>DoCSSa is based on Sass, and leverages some of its key features to achieve its goal.
                            Most notably, DoCSSa takes advantage of imports and mixins.
                            It also suggests a file system organisation and a BEM based naming convention, and integrates
                            the core ideas found in OOCSS and SmaCSS.</p>

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Basics</h2>

                        <p>In DoCSSa, the file system is divided in four main directories in the sass folder :</p>

                        <ul class="firstOrderList">
                            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_base">base</a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_components">components</a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_specifics">specifics</a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    <a class="navLink" href="#fileStructure_vendor">vendor</a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Each base folder has a specific role, and CSS rules for a particular set of elements will end up in one of
                            these directories, according to their nature.<br>
                            The structure has a single point of entry, which we'll call <em>custom.scss</em>.
                            This file is located at the root of the sass folder.</p>

                        <p class="note">In most cases, it will be the only file with no
                            underscore(_) prefix : as you may know, the .scss to .css convertion process in Sass only converts
                            files that don't have an underscore in front of them. Most of the files in our structure being imported
                            by other files, they don't need to be rendered directly.<br>
                            Only components may be rendered separately, in order to be able to dynamically load them if needed,
                            but we'll get back to it.
                        </p>

                        <p>The main .scss file will look something like this :</p>

                        <div class="sample">
                            <ul class="sampleHeader">
                                <li class="sampleHeader_item _is_current">
                                    <span class="sampleHeader_link">// custom.scss</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

<pre class="codeSample">

/*!

// styles reset (normalize) and third party scss entry point

                        </div>

                        <p>As you can see, it mostly acts as an aggregator for other files, which themselves import some
                            other scss files, and so on. With a well thought organization, this simple construct can prove very powerful!</p>

                        <p class="note">On a sidenote, remember that Sass is only a CSS precompiler, so you'll end up with only one .css file
                            with all the goodies, not a bunch of HTTP requests!</p>

                        <p>Here is an overview of what a basic file system might look like :</p>

                        <p>The "base" folder contains rules that are global to the site. It is divided in two parts : </p>

                                </div>
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="note">Note that the <em>base/_config.scss</em> file is located directly in the base
                            folder. It contains variables that are required by both the utils and the project. So far
                            only the $baseFontSize fell in that category.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong id="fileStructure_base_utils">Utils</strong> contains only things that don't need to change
                            from a project to another. As of today, it consists of <em>_system</em> and <em>_mixins</em>.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="secondaryList">
                            <li class="secondaryList_item">

                                    <p><em>_system</em> is a special file that contains tools used by DoCSSa.<br>
                                        Most notably, it contains a mixin that helps requiring content
                                        from several places without generating duplicate content, and one that helps
                                        the provided components to make use of Modernizr classes.
                                    </p>

                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="secondaryList_item">
                                <div class="secondaryList_item_content">
                                    <p><strong>_mixins</strong> contains a collection of commonly used helpers.
                                        They are particularily useful for handling vendor prefixes and
                                        fallbacks. For example, DoCSSa comes with a linear-gradient mixin that compiles to
                                        all required vendor prefixes (and only those required!) and generates a fallback
                                        color from the input values for browsers that don't support linear-gradient at all.
                                        DoCSSa recommends using Modernizr for feature detection and progressive enhancement, and the provided
                                        mixins implementing CSS3 features rely on it by default for their output, even though it can be
                                        disabled at include time.<br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="note">Mixins can accumulate and enrich your library
                                        with no cost, as they are only compiled when used.<br>
                                        Mixins are a great way to avoid repetition when coding. They end up in code
                                        repetition in the css output, and for that reason the previous version of DoCSSa
                                        was based on placeholders insted, but it has now been proven that this repetition
                                        is not an issue once gzip comes into play (more info at

                                        In our implementation, we use a font mixin that is in charge of generating a bulletproof syntax
                                        according to the passed configuration for each needed font, according to a file naming convention.</p>

                                    <p class="note"> But where do we have to place the font files themselves, you may be wondering? Well, as
                                        this Sass structure is
                                        intended to be compiled to CSS in a different directory, the fonts will be in that directory.
                                        Typically, you'll have the <em>custom.scss</em> file in a "sass" folder" compiled to a
                                        <em>custom.css</em> in a
                                        "css" or "styles" folder. The font files will have to be there (preferably in a "fonts"
                                        subfolder in order to stay nice and tidy).<br>
                                        Same goes for all the image files you may be referring to in your stylesheets.

                                        to the site. Things like box-sizing type, html font size, body background color,
                                        headings and link defaults, etc. are defined here. It is also be a good place to store
                                        your layout definition if it is used for all pages on the site.

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_components">Components folder</h2>

                        <p>
                            The "components" folder is where your ui-components are located. It is the place dedicated to
                            store your reusable UI appearance.<br>
                            Components are an important part of DoCSSa, and we dedicated a whole section to explain all there is to know about them,
                            so we won't say much more about them here.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_specifics">Specifics folder</h2>

                        <p>The "specifics" folder is your common playground. It is where you'll place the rules that don't belong
                            in the "base" or "components" folders. Until you become fluent with DoCSSa's organization system, what will
                            eventually end up in a component will probably exist in here first.</p>

                        <p>Specifics is the closest thing to your usual CSS file, except that everything in there
                            is split and dispatched in files and folders according to what they apply to. This fragmentation
                            is key to keeping things maintainable!</p>

                        <p>By convention, we're using two underscores(__) as a prefix for files that act as an import
                            summary, and only one underscore(_) for files which are content only. This usually evolves with the
                            project: you begin with an underscore prefixed file, you add another one, and at some point you stop calling them
                            directly from the main .scss file and you reorganize them in a folder with its own summary file. </p>
                        <aside class="exampleNote">
                            <p>For example you might begin writing some rules in specifics/__specifics.scss, and as it grows
                                realize that you have a bunch of rules all related to the popin windows. You'd then move those rules in a
                                _popin.scss file and import that file from __specifics.scss.</p>

                            <p>
                                After a while, you'll notice that you added some rules for a
                                bunch of specific popins on your site. That would be a good time to create a "popins" folder and
                                split the specific popin rules to different files in that folder (say, popins/_popin-loginForm.scss
                                and popins/_popin-congratulations.scss).<br>
                                Instead of importing _popins.scss from __specifics.scss, you'd then import popins/__popins.scss
                                instead, and let this summary file import all the specific popins required for your project.</p>

                            <p>This allow you to have all your feature related files in the same folder, and one summary
                                specific to that kind of feature which can import or leave out the files in its section as easily as commenting out a
                                line. If at some point you realize that you don't want to use the congratulations popin anymore, all you
                                have to do is to comment out the line importing its definition file (_popin-congratulations.scss) from the
                                popins summary (popins/__popins.scss).</p>
                        </aside>

                        <p class="note">DoCSSa encourages you to keep your definitions tidy and reorganize in subfolders as soon as it makes
                            sense.<br>
                            No file should ever be big enough that you can't scroll through it in a few mousewheel movements
                            max.</p>

                        <p>Before everyone in your team is familiar with DoCSSa, it can be helpful for occasional contributors
                            wondering where to place their code to have a dedicated file. In such case, we recommend using
                            a <em>_inbox.scss</em> file in the "specifics" folder and ask them to commit their work in there.<br>
                            It shall be emptied regularly by a more experienced DoCSSa user, who would move the CSS rules
                            defined in there to the correct place in the architecture.

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle" id="fileStructure_vendor">Vendor folder</h2>

                        <p>The <em>vendor</em> folder is where we import/place SCSS files that come from third parties and can be updated at
                            any time. As the .scss syntax is CSS compatible, all we have to do is to rename the .css files to
                            .scss, in order for them to be integrated to the .css compilation instead of referenced by the CSS
                            file as a classic @import.</p>

                        <p class="note"><em>_normalize.scss</em> is an excellent candidate for this section, along with more project specific
                            third party CSS. We currently rely on bower for fetching it for us.</p>

                        <p>Components are an important part of DoCSSa. They have been redesigned since version 1 of DoCSSa
                            to become simpler and easier to use. They are the "Deferred Object" part of DoCCSa.
                        </p>
                        <p>We say the Object is Deferred because its core resides in an abstraction (the mixin)
                            instead of being tied to a classname. DoCSSa's components are class agnostic. They are made of mixins.
                            A component mixin is in charge of binding the reusable styling to one or several HTML class(es).
                            Thanks to the BEM naming convention, the class passed to the component mixin can be
                            a prefix for other classes onto which to bind functionalities.
                        </p>
                        <p>This allows for components to be instantiated on any class, and to be composable if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>As the component is not tied to a particular class, you can use it on whatever class you want, whenever you want,
                            from the stylesheet side. That means that you can (and should) keep a semantic meaning to your HTML classes, and change
                            their look and feel without having to modify the markup. When your markup comes from a RTE, this is a huge gain.
                            You can change the styling without asking the contributors to change their habits, and you can
                            affect everything already written without having to make search&amp;replace throughout a database or without
                            having a "red" class helper mean the color is going to be purple!
                        </p>
                        <p class="exampleNote">
                            For example, instead of having a link with the "button red" classes, you can give it a "navTrigger"
                            class and bind a button component with a red skin to it. You could
                            also use the same component on a "submitTrigger" class so that both look the same. When time comes
                            to have a different look for your submits, all you have to do is bind the submitTrigger to another component
                            and you're done, without affecting the navTriggers and without touching the markup.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you need a component with a slightly different behaviour than the original one, you  can pass
                            a parameter to the mixin to change the binding (or rules). If the exceptions become too numerous,
                            it's probably time to consider creating another component or a set of small components.

                                    component doesn't belong in the component definition. Typically, things like margins or positioning
                                    should reside in the "specifics" folder, not in the component. This is required for your component to
                                    live in any possible context.</p>

                                <p class="note">For example, background color, images, text colors, etc. may go into the skin section of the
                                    component, not in its core definition. That way, you can create additional styles for them without
                                    altering their expected behaviour as a component, and choose what visual style you want when binding
                                    the component to a classname.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Of course, it's up to you to compose with those precepts and adapt them to your constraints, but
                            respecting them results in a clean separation of concerns and genuinely reusable components, which is much
                            likely to make your dev faster further down the road, and that
                            is what DoCSSa is aiming for.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            When beginning with DoCSSa, it's easy to think as everything as components, as they are so powerful.
                            You must be careful about that, and think about what needs to be a component and what doesn't.<br>
                            If you component-ize every set of rules, you risk spending more time building the same thing as you
                            would have in the "specifics" folder without enough additional value for it to be worth it.
                            Try to begin with small components to get the hang of it, and adjust your use little by little.<br>
                            You can begin everything the way you are used to in the "specifics" folder, organize it
                            in imported files and subfolders the DoCSSa way, and only extract a functionality to a component
                            when you feel that it would help you.<br>
                            DoCSSa only gives you tools to play with, what you implement and how you do things with it is up to you.
                            That's what we believe a "framework" should be anyway.

                        <p>When looking at a component folder, you will see one file, and possibly some subfolders.
                            Let's take a <em>Tabs</em> component as an example, as probably everyone has already seen a tabbed
                            navigation in a page. The file in the Tabs folder would be: <em>_tabs.scss</em>.<br>
                            It is the component definition. Let's look at it in details.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mainSection_smallTitle" id="components_definition">Component's definition</h3>
                        <p>The component definition file contains two mixins. One for the component structure, one for
                            the component's skin.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here's the <em>structure</em> part of our "tabs" component :</p>

                        <div class="sample">
                            <ul class="sampleHeader">

                            </ul>
<pre class="codeSample">

// _____ STRUCTURE _____ //



// map the placeholders content to some selectors through a mixin
@mixin tabs($selector, $defaultSkin: true) {

  #{$selector} {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 0;

    @include tabs-skin-default($selector);
  }

}
</pre>

                        </div>

                        <p>A mixin named after the component is all it takes. Its role is to
                            actually bind the component's styling rules to the provided classname, its "elements", and its state.
                        </p>
                        <p>By default, the component binding will also implement the default skin. If we have defined another
                            skin, all we need to do is pass "$defaultSkin: false" when instantiating the component, and
                            call another skin binding mixin to handle the component's skin.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">We said earlier that a component folder may have subfolders. One of those is a "_skins"
                            folder that would host different skins that we could import as needed. The "_skins" folder
                            is prefixed by an underscore only so that it always show on top of the list in case you need
                            some other folders in there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let's look at the <em>skin</em> part of our "tabs" component :

    &amp;._is_current {
      border-bottom: solid 3px $color-main;

}
</pre>

                        <p>As you can see, it is very close to the structure part. Actually it is placed inside the component's
                            folder for simplicity, but it could very well reside in a _skins folder right away.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">We recommend that the "structure" part of the component doesn't make use of any
                            project variable in order to stay as generic and reusable as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">As stated before, a component's "structure" should only contain it's layout, it's skeleton.
                            The "skin" part, unlike the structure, should
                            <em>only contain</em> rules that <em>don't affect</em> the structure. These rules can be
                            background-colors, background-images, border-radius, shadows, opacity... Anything you want as long as it doesn't
                            fiddle with the component's external boundaries.<br>
                            It is not always easy, but the more you practice it the
                            more it feels natural, and the easier it is to find out the right place when you come back to adjust
                            something about your component.

                        <p>In DoCSSa, we decided to follow BEM class naming convention.<br>
                            HTML class names for <em>Blocks</em> are lowerCamelCase, and the <em>Elements</em> nested
                            within are separated by
                            an underscore(_). <em>Modifiers</em> are separated by a double dash(--), and they are used
                            for elements
                            <em>variants</em>. An element's <em>state</em> is written separately with a pattern that
                            begins with "_is_".
                        </p>

                        <p class="note">
                            <em>Variants</em> are dissociated from <em>states</em> because they play a different role,
                            and it appeared that with our components architecture, having a simple "_is_current" class for our items'
                            "current" state was way more effective than a "mainMenu_item--current" when it came to modifying the state through
                            javascript.<br>
                            BEM modifiers are now exclusively used for visual variants that don't change over time. They
                            have a meaning at the content(HTML) level. For example, if a tab needs to be highlighted so that
                            it stands out, it is applied a variant by using a modifier.<br>
                            By opposition, a "state" is something that is supposed to be handled by javascript and
                            change over time.
                        </p>

                            Note that this example is taken from the menu you're looking at just now in the present

                        <p>At first, the BEM notation style can seem quite verbose and put off some developers, but it
                            is very powerful and allows us to go way behind old school naming conventions.<br>
                            It has to be tamed, though, and a classic beginner's mistake is to reflect the position of
                            each element in the component's DOM in its class name. To avoid that, we recommend that you look
                            at your low level elements first (those deeper in the DOM tree) and wonder if they could exist
                            elsewhere in the page or in the component.
                            Going up the tree, you can identify your most basic reusable components and set the names
                            accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <p class="exampleNote">
                            For example, in our example above, the "mainMenu_link" class doesn't need to reflect the
                            fact that it is contained in a "mainMenu_item", this doesn't really matter to the link, so there is no
                            reason to specify it in its name.<br>
                            Also, if the element can live outside the block you're looking at, it's probably not a good
                            idea to tie it to it, and it probably should exist on its own.

                        <h2 class="mainSection_subtitle">Sass files</h2>

                        <p>We talked about some of the aspects of the Sass file naming convention in the "File
                            Structure" section.</p>

                        <p>Each file is lowerCamelCase named and prefixed by an underscore(_) so that it is considered
                            by the Sass compiler as a partial and not rendered to a standalone CSS file.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each folder has a single entry point in charge of importing other partial Sass files. This
                            file is named after the folder's name, and is prefixed with two underscores(__) so that it always
                            appears on top in the files list. It imports only the files in its own folder, except for other summary
                            indexes located in a direct subfolder. This way, you always can handle your imports very easily and stop the
                            imports of nested files at any level.<br>
                            Components definition files should have the same name as the component's folder name, and
                            have a single underscore prefix, as they are content and not imports list.
                        </p>

                        <h2>SASS variables</h2>

                        <p>Sass variable names should be composed of dash(-) separated parts, with each part sorted from
                            the most generic to the most specific variable characteristic. This is quite useful in most IDE as
                            you can take advantage of autocompletion.

                                    First, you can simply write CSS code in separated files into the "specifics" folder,
                                    using DoCSSa's logic.
                                </div>
                            </li>

                                    Then, try manipulating the provided "_mixins" from the base/utils folder
                                    to give your project more reusable code.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li class="firstOrderList_item">
                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    After that, you may write your own "_mixins", tailored for your own
                                    specific needs.
                                </div>

                                <div class="firstOrderList_item_content">
                                    For more reusability within or across your project(s), you may then try to convert
                                    some of your "specifics" rules into "components".<br>
                                    If see you are repeating the same rules on different sets of classes, you have a good candidate.
                                </div>
                            </li>
